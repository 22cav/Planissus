Planissus Life Simulation

Project Overview

Planissus is a life simulation project that creates a grid-based visual representation of a planet. The planet is made up of water and ground cells, each inhabited by different species. The simulation updates daily, displaying the evolving interactions between the species.

Key Species:

	1.	Erbast: Herbivore-like creatures that feed on Vegetob.
	2.	Vegetob: A plant-like species that serves as nourishment for Erbast.
	3.	Carviz: Carnivore-like creatures that hunt Erbast.

Features

	•	Grid-based World: The planet is displayed as a grid of cells (water or ground) with various species inhabiting the ground cells.
	•	Dynamic Simulation: The population and movement of the species update daily, simulating a life cycle.
	•	User Interaction:
	•	Pause, restart, or generate a new world.
	•	Hover and click on a cell to view detailed data and real-time graph tracing.
	•	Graphical Data: Users can access:
	•	Real-time Data: View the current state of a selected cell.
	•	Histogram: Displays the distribution of creatures in the selected cell.
	•	Line Graph: Tracks the population trends of each species within the cell over time.

Usage

	1.	Start/Restart Simulation: The user can start or reset the simulation to generate a new planet.
	2.	Pause/Resume: Pause the simulation to inspect any cell or resume it to continue observing.
	3.	Data Analysis: Click on any ground cell to view the current species’ populations and graphical representation of their trends.
