This project was made following the instructions from the file 2022_23_planisuss_v0.95.pdf, also contained in the folder.


The code is entirely stored in the main.py file.
It simulates an active environment with three creatures: Vegetob, Erbast, Carvix

The libraries used are the following:
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Random
- Tkinter (and extensions)

I created a Virtual Environment with PyCharm and included it in the project folder, so that it can be easier to run.

The project was made by Matteo Caviglia and Sofia Gaia Formenti.
